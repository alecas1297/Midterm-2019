What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A. JDK stands for Java Runtime Environment which includes Java Virtual Machine. It has different components and some of them are:

   Java Compiler - converts source code into java bytecode
   Java Interpreter - interprets class file generated by compiler
   Java Disassembler - disassembles class file
   Java Documentation - creates documentation from source code comment
   Java Debugger - tests and debug java program
   Java Applet Viewer - can be used to run and debug Java applet





What is IDE?
A.Integrated Development Environment




What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A.Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans, BlueJ



Explain the entire java life cycle.
- In the first step, source code is written using a text editor and saved as a .java file. It is then passed to Java compiler which transformed the source code to byte code and creates a .class file. The .class file is loaded to JVM which converts the code to machine understandable language and pass to operating system which present the output of the code.

What is object?

    final method can't be changed by a child class

What is JAR stand for ?
- Java Archive

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
What is the difference between JVM and JRE?

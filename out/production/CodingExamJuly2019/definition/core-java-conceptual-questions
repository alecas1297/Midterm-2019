Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
- is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks




What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
- JDK stands for Java Runtime Environment which includes Java Virtual Machine. It has different components and some of them are:

   Java Compiler - converts source code into java bytecode
   Java Interpreter - interprets class file generated by compiler
   Java Disassembler - disassembles class file
   Java Documentation - creates documentation from source code comment
   Java Debugger - tests and debug java program
   Java Applet Viewer - can be used to run and debug Java applet





What is IDE?
- Integrated Development Environment




What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
- Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans, BlueJ



Explain the entire java life cycle.
- In the first step, source code is written using a text editor and saved as a .java file. It is then passed to Java compiler which transformed the source code to byte code and creates a .class file. The .class file is loaded to JVM which converts the code to machine understandable language and pass to operating system which present the output of the code.


what is class?
- Where you define your objects

What is object?
- Is a combination of data and procedures working on the available data, The state of an object is stored in fields (variables), while methods (functions) display the object's behavior.

What is the entry point of an application?
- The "main" method is the entry point of an application in java

Why main is static?
- The main method is static because it can be initiated without creating an instance of it

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
- The “Object”(java.lang.object) class is at the root/base level of the Class hierarchy in Java.

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
- PATH is an environment variable. It is used by operating system to find the executable files (.exe) or in other words java binaries (java or javac).
    CLASSPATH is also an environment variable used by Application ClassLoader to locate and load the .class files(compiled java bytecodes)

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
- In interface class, you can't implement any method but in abstract class you are allowed to implement non-abstract method.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
- No. You use "new" to create an object from an interface and abstract class

what is Access Specifier?
- Access specifier are keywords to set accessibility of classes, methods and variable. Public, Private, Protected.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
- -Object Oriented Programming
  Abstraction - a way to hide implementation from interface
  Encapsulation - is a form of data hiding
  Inheritance - is a process by which one object acquires all the properties of parent object
  Polymorphism - is the ability of an object to take on many forms

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
- A Java package organizes Java classes into namespaces, providing a unique namespace for each type it contains, is more likely a folder in which you have documents. 

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
- Application Programming Interface. File Reader and Buffer Reader

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
- No, Java Does not support multiple inheritance because it creates confusion and complexity. To avoid ambiguity error java does not support multiple inheritance through class.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
- Method overriding is when a child class changes an existing method of a parent class.  It happens in runtime.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
- An exceptions is a problem that arises during the execution of a program. When an Exception occurs the normal
  flow of the program is disrupted and the program/Application terminates abnormally.Java provides two different
  options to handle an exception. We can either use the try-catch-finally approach to handle all kinds of exceptions.
  Or you can use the try-with-resource approach which allows an easier cleanup process for resources.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
- "static" keyword is a member of a class that isn’t associated with an instance of a class.
    Static variable belongs to the class not to any object
    Static method allows to access class properties without creating an object

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
- "final" keyword is used to prevent changing of values in java
    final variable's value cannot be changed by local variable or member variable
    final method can't be changed by a child class

What is final, finally and finalize?
-Final for a variable sets its value permanently
    Finally is a block which is a part of exception handling with try catch which always occurs if the tyr block exists
    Finalize is used to call java garbage collector to kill an unused object

What is a constructor ?
- A constructor is a type of method to initialize an object

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
- A class can have multiple constructors, as long as their parameters are not the same

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
What is "this" keyword in java ?
-"this" keyword is used to refer to current class instance variable

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
- super key word used for accessing the members of the super class by the extended class.

What is JVM stand for ?
- Java Virtual Machine

Is JVM platform independent?
What version of java are you using?
- 1.8

What is JAR stand for ?
- Java Archive

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
- Java Development Kit (JDK) is the development environment used for developing Java applications and includes the
  Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (java), the javac compiler, and thb JAR archivers.JVM is java
  virtual machine and executes bytecode at runtime.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
- JVM is the heart of java programming language. When we run a program, JVM is responsible to converting Byte code to
  the machine specific code.JRE is the implementation of JVM, it provides platform to execute java programs.

What is compile time and run time?
- compile time is when JAVAC takes a java text tile, checks for errors in code and creates the 'class file which can
  be run. Runtime is when the JVM executes the .class file


What is heap?
- Heap is where objects are loaded in RAM

How java manage it's memory?
- Java has a garbage collector that automatically kills object that is not being used

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
-String is immutable whereas StringBuffer and StringBuider are mutable classes. StringBuffer is thread safe and synchronized whereas StringBuilder is not, thats why StringBuilder is more faster than StringBuffer.

What is Singleton class?
- Singleton Class is a class that allow only single object.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
- Serialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization.

when to use transient variable in java?
- When we do not want the variable serialized.


Difference between while and do..while loop?
- while loop only performs while a specific condition is true. Do while performs at least 1 iteration.

What is Enum?
-An enum is a special type of data type which is basically a collection (set) of constants.

What is Iterator?
- Iterators are used in Collection framework in Java to retrieve elements one by one.


Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
- Integer

Why is String Immutable in Java?
- To prevent security issues

What is constructor chaining in Java?
- is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
-Serial is the simplest but stops all threads so it sucks in a server environment.parallel is the default collector
 it scans multiple threads and has less impact on stopping threads

What is JIT stands for?
- Just in time

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
- At run-time the Java instances are stored in the heap memory area. When an object is not referenced anymore it becomes
  eligible for removal from heap memory.During garbage collection process, those objects are removed from heap memory and
  the space is reclaimed. Java garbage collection is an automatic process to manage the runtime memory used by programs.
  Garbage connection of JAVA application is done by Garbage collector.


Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
- no

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
- The main difference between heap and stack is that stack memory is used to store local variables and function call
  while heap memory is used to store objects in Java.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
- Reflection is an API which is used to examine or modify the behavior of methods, classes, interfaces at runtime.

what is multithreading in java?
- is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
- With respect to multithreading, synchronization is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to shared
  resources.

What is Framework?
- Java Frameworks are nothing but large bodies of predefined Java code which we can apply to our own code to solve
  the problem in a specific domain.

What are the testing Framework available in java?
- Selenium, JUnit, testing, mockito, jwalk, Cucumber, Spring Test etc.

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
- The process of parameterized test configuration in TestNG is easier than
 in JUnit (it requires more time and effort).
  JUnit does not support group test, while in TestNG,
  the specialists are able to administrate certain tests to a large group of people at the same time.

What are the dependencies for this project?
- Dependencies define in which order project tasks and activities should be carried out.

what is dependency injection in java?
- when a class is created using the new operator, the class isgit dependant on the parent class. New injects the dependency.

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
- static occurs during compile time, dynamic during run time.
